## 📌 Description
Refactor the existing agent credentials system to support dynamic, extensible integrations (Socials, Email with full login details) instead of hardcoded database columns. This allows adding multiple accounts per agent and makes it easier to support future integrations.

### ✅ Requirements
1. **Database Schema**: Create an `agent_integrations` table with encrypted credentials.
2. **Server Actions**: Update `createAgent` and `updateAgent` to handle an array of integrations and handle encryption/decryption securely.
3. **UI Components**: Build an `IntegrationsList` component with specific forms for Email, GitHub, Twitter, and Telegram.
