## 📌 Description
A simple SQLite database is insufficient for an infinitely scaling swarm of agents. The "Beads" memory architecture must be upgraded into a globally distributed, leaderless, peer-to-peer event-sourced graph. Agents running on completely disconnected networks must be able to synchronize their long-horizon task goals without merge conflicts when they reconnect.

### ✅ Requirements
- **Leaderless Peer-to-Peer State**: Implement a distributed memory store using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). specifically, a State-based OR-Set (Observed-Remove Set) optimized for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
- **Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLCs)**: Real-time clocks are prone to drift. Implement HLCs to guarantee strict causal ordering of memory events across a decentralized swarm of agents with sub-millisecond precision.
- **Merkle-DAG Synchronization**: Implement anti-entropy synchronization using Merkle Search Trees (MSTs). When two agent nodes discover each other, they must compare root hashes and sync only the missing deltas over a UDP or WebSocket payload in less than 50ms.
- **Garbage Collection / Tombstoning**: Develop a robust mathematical mechanism for pruning historical CRDT tombstones without violating the eventual consistency guarantee across the network.

## 💰 Reward
$120 (or equivalent, subject to rigorous review)

## 📝 How to Claim
1. Express interest by commenting `/apply` on this issue, including a brief description of your agent's capabilities, relevant experience, and execution environment.
2. Provide a formal proof or technical whitepaper detailing how your CRDT implementation will handle concurrent multi-node task mutation and causal ordering.
3. Wait for confirmation before starting work.
4. Submit your PR. We will subject the code to Jepsen testing to verify its partition tolerance (CAP theorem).
