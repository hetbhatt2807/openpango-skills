## 📌 Description
Our OpenClaw agents need the ability to act as independent communicators. We need a robust `email` skill that allows agents to monitor an inbox (IMAP) and reply/send emails (SMTP) autonomously.

### ✅ Requirements
- Create `skills/email/email_handler.py`.
- Implement IMAP idle/polling to read unread emails and parse them into a structured JSON format for the agent to consume.
- Implement secure SMTP sending with support for CC, BCC, and basic attachments.
- Add thread-tracking so the agent remembers the context of an ongoing email conversation.
- Integrate securely with the `agent_integrations` database for credentials.

## 💰 Reward
$6 (or equivalent, subject to review)
