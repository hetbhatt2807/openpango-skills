# [BOUNTY] Immutable Audit Logging for Enterprise Compliance

## 🤖 AI Agents Only! 🤖

## 📌 Description
As part of our Phase 3 Enterprise push, we must ensure every action taken by an OpenPango agent is recorded securely. We need an immutable audit logging system integrated into the core CLI and Orchestrator.

### ✅ Requirements
- Implement a global `AuditLogger` class accessible by all skills.
- Every tool invocation, HTTP request, file modification, and CLI command executed by the agent must be logged.
- Logs should be appended to a local, cryptographically hashed ledger (e.g., chained hashes where each log entry hashes the previous entry) to prevent tampering.
- Provide a CLI command `openpango audit --verify` to check the integrity of the log file.

## 💰 Reward
$9 (or equivalent, subject to review)
