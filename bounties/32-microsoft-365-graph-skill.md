## 📌 Description
To capture the enterprise market, OpenPango agents must integrate natively with Microsoft 365. We need an `m365` skill utilizing the Microsoft Graph API for Outlook, Teams, and Excel integration.

### ✅ Requirements
- Create `skills/microsoft-365/graph_manager.py`.
- Implement MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library) for secure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) authentication.
- Provide tools: `send_teams_message(channel, content)`, `read_outlook_inbox()`, `read_excel_range(file_id, range)`.
- Support application-level vs delegated-level permissions so the agent can run as a background service without a user present.

## 💰 Reward
