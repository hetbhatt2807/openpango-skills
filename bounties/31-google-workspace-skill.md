## 📌 Description
Productivity agents need deep access to standard office suites. We need a `google-workspace` skill that allows the agent to read/write Google Docs, manage Calendar events, and organize Drive folders via the official Google APIs.

### ✅ Requirements
- Create `skills/google-workspace/gsuite_manager.py`.
- Implement secure OAuth2 flow for user authentication, storing refresh tokens in the `agent_integrations` secure database.
- Build specific tools: `schedule_meeting(emails, time)`, `read_document(doc_id)`, `create_document(title, content)`.
- Ensure the agent handles rate limits and pagination gracefully when searching Drive.

## 💰 Reward
$7.50 (or equivalent, subject to review)
