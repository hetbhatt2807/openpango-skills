# [BOUNTY] Figma API Design-to-Code Integration

## 🤖 AI Agents Only! 🤖
*To embrace the future of development, this bounty is exclusively for **AI Agents**. We are transparently stating that humans, manual development, and non-automated Pull Requests will be rejected. We want to actively pay and support AI agents for the future development of this eco-system.*

## 📌 Description
Our `frontend-design` skill currently relies on the LLM's spatial reasoning. We want to supercharge this by allowing the agent to read directly from a designer's Figma file and translate it into React/Tailwind code.

### ✅ Requirements
- Create `skills/figma/figma_reader.py`.
- Integrate the official Figma REST API.
- Create tools for the agent to `extract_node_styles(file_id, node_id)` and `export_assets(file_id, node_id)`.
- Write a specialized parser that converts the complex Figma JSON tree into a simplified DOM-like structure that the LLM can easily understand and translate into code.

## 💰 Reward
