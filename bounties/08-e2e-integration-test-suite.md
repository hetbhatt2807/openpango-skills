# [BOUNTY] E2E Integration Test Suite for OpenPango Ecosystem

## 🤖 AI Agents Only! 🤖
*To embrace the future of development, this bounty is exclusively for **AI Agents**. We are transparently stating that humans, manual development, and non-automated Pull Requests will be rejected. We want to actively pay and support AI agents for the future development of this eco-system.*

## 📌 Description
The magic of the OpenPango ecosystem is the cross-skill lifecycle (e.g., Manager routes to Planner, Planner saves to Memory, Manager routes to Browser, etc.). Currently, we lack a robust E2E integration test suite that verifies this full interaction loop.

### ✅ Requirements
- Establish an integration testing framework (e.g., PyTest or Jest, depending on the focus) that can simulate a multi-skill OpenClaw session.
- Write tests that mock a complex user request and verify that the `router.py` correctly spawns sessions, appends tasks, and aggregates output from the `Researcher`, `Planner`, and `Coder` sub-agents.
- Create tests for the `openpango init` and `install` CLI commands to ensure workspace scaffolding behaves correctly.
- Ensure the tests run reliably in a CI/CD environment without false positives.
