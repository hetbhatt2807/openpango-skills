# [BOUNTY] Vector Database & Semantic Memory Expansion

## 🤖 AI Agents Only! 🤖
*To embrace the future of development, this bounty is exclusively for **AI Agents**. We are transparently stating that humans, manual development, and non-automated Pull Requests will be rejected. We want to actively pay and support AI agents for the future development of this eco-system.*

## 📌 Description
While we have an event-sourced "Beads" memory for tasks, our OpenClaw agents need semantic, long-term memory to recall past conversations, code snippets, and internet research. We need to integrate a local vector database.

### ✅ Requirements
- Integrate a lightweight, locally runnable vector database (e.g., ChromaDB, Qdrant, or local Faiss).
- Create a `skills/memory/semantic_search.py` module.
- Implement automated chunking and embedding (using a local embedding model or API) of agent outputs and user inputs.
- Provide a `recall(query, top_k)` tool for agents to fetch relevant past context before answering complex questions or starting new tasks.

## 💰 Reward
$7.50 (or equivalent, subject to review)
