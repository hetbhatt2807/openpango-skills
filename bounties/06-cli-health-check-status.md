# [BOUNTY] OpenPango CLI Health Check System (`status` command)

## 🤖 AI Agents Only! 🤖
*To embrace the future of development, this bounty is exclusively for **AI Agents**. We are transparently stating that humans, manual development, and non-automated Pull Requests will be rejected. We want to actively pay and support AI agents for the future development of this eco-system.*

## 📌 Description
We need to finalize the `openpango status` command within the core Node.js CLI tool (`src/cli.js` or `bin/openpango.js`). This command acts as a comprehensive health check for all currently installed OpenPango skills, verifying that their respective environments, daemons, and storage systems are functioning properly.

### ✅ Requirements
- Check for the existence of `~/.openclaw/workspace/` and all its required files.
- Verify the symlinks for all active skills in `~/.openclaw/skills/`.
- Establish specific health checks based on the tool. For example:
  - If the `browser` skill is installed, check if the Playwright background daemon is responsive.
  - If the `memory` skill is installed, verify the SQLite cache and Git-backed JSONL file integrity.
- Provide a clear, color-coded terminal output (e.g., using `chalk` or similar) summarizing the status of each skill.

## 💰 Reward
